A 61-year old furniture salesman was pushed down the shaft of a freight elevator yesterday in his downtown Brooklyn store by two robbers while a third attempted to crush him with the elevator car because they were dissatisfied with the $1,200 they had forced him to give them. The buffer springs at the bottom of the shaft prevented the car from crushing the salesman, John J. Hug, after he was pushed from the first floor to the basement. The car stopped about 12 inches above him as he flattened himself at the bottom of the pit. 1 Mr. Hug was pinned in the shaft for about half an hour until his cries attracted the attention of a porter. The store at 340 Livingston Street is part of the Seamanâ€™s Quality Furniture chain. Mr. Hug was removed by members of the Police Emergency Squad and taken to Long Island College Hospital. He was badly shaken, but after being treated for scrapes of his left arm and for a spinal injury was released and went home. He lives at 62-01 69th Lane, Maspeth, Queens. He has worked for seven years at the store, on the corner of Nevins Street, and this was the fourth time he had been held up in the store. The last time was about one year ago, when his right arm was slashed by a knife-wielding robber.
